Change Log:

Release 13 beta 1:
  	- Added Memory/Swap Graphs section ("M" key activates)
 	- Added the ability for elmon to display 2 or 3 columns worth of data if the terminal is wide enough. 
 	- Added "C" option to toggle multi-column display off. (default is on)
 	- Updated Disk Graph output to use same solid color output as CPU graphs.
 	- Added a interactive help/menu system that supports the mouse (if available) 
 	  and also has the ability to use the arrow keys to interactivly control elmon.
 	- Fixed bug that occured if you enabled both show_verbose and show_disk, and then disabled show_disk.
 	- Fixed bug where if you only had show verbose enabled ("v") elmon would not
 	  update the CPU stats
 	- elmon will now display the stat sections in the order that the user enables
  	  them, with the following exceptions:
 		-Help and Verbose windows are always at the top
 		-Top processes is always at the bottom
 		-If you are in multicolumn mode elmon will check to see if the window
 	 	 would better fit in another column
 	- David Baril's fix for bug when reading disk group file from nmon forum.  
	  Previously elmon would only read 2048 bytes per line of the disk group file.  
	  elmon supports up to 512 disk per disk group, so 2048 bytes isn't big enough.  
	  This was increased to 4096.
 	- David Baril's fix for a bug with the disk groups from nmon forum.  Disk group 
	  stats would only be updated if other disk related stats were enabled.  
 	- Fix for bug when displaying disk groups with show only active disk mode
 	  enabled (".").  Bug was discovered by David Baril and reported on nmon forum.
 	- Updated long term CPU graph ('l') so it is no longer limited to a fixed width 
          of 72 columns.  It will now be as wide as the terminal or column is.  
 	- Added support for screen refreshes of less than 1 second.  This was added in
 	  to make the long term CPU graph changes easier to test.  This might
 	  be useful to some people so I left it in.  
 	- Added a check when reading the "-s" parameter.  In previous versions,
 	  if the user specified something invalid ("-s AA") elmon would set seconds=0
 	  and elmon would not work correctly.  Now it will default to 2 seconds.  
 	- Only display first 6 characters of interface name when displaying network 
 	  stats (on my system I have a couple of interfaces that are more than 6
 	  characters and it would make the columns not line up)
 	- Fixed bug where disk graph option would put the peak ">" past 100% 
 	  (used same method to prevent this that was used for the CPU section)
 	- Fixed bug where cpu option would always put the peak ">" one character
 	  past the displayed value.  Also fixed bug that occured when the CPU 
 	  was busy and then dropped down, elmon would sometimes not update the screen
 	  correctly and leave 1 bar of CPU showing at the end of the line.  
 	- Instead of the main loop sleeping in 1 second increments, it now sleeps in
 	  1/10 of a second increments.  This makes the application respond faster to
 	  the user when they press keys.
